## Overview

Pentago is a fast-paced and dynamic game that combines elements of strategy and unpredictability. The game board consists of a 6x6 grid divided into four quadrants, and each turn involves placing a marble on the board and then rotating one of the quadrants. The objective is to get five marbles of your color in a row – horizontally, vertically, or diagonally – or create a set of five where each marble is in a different quadrant.

## How To Play

1. **Placing Marbles:**

   Click on an empty cell to place your marble. The game will automatically switch turns between players.

2. **Rotating Quadrants:**

   After placing a marble, choose a quadrant to rotate. Watch as the game board transforms, adding a layer of strategy to your gameplay.

3. **Winning the Game:**

   The first player to achieve five marbles in a row or create a set of five in different quadrants wins the game!
